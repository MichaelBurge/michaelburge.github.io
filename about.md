I'm a software developer with experience in data engineering, low-level programming, compiler development, databases, networking, and web development. Currently, I'm studying Machine Learning because you can do cool things like generate art.

Here I'll post tips, articles, and share projects I've done. Feel free to contact me if any of it is interesting to you.
